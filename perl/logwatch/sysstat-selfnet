# This script prints out information about the CPU utilization for the
# system, the CPU utilization for the currently working Linux tasks and
# the memory utilization - all for the working Linux tasks at the moment 
# the report is generated.
# To do this the 'iostat' and the 'pidstat' utilities from the 'sysstat' 
# package are being used.
